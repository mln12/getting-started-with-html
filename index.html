  <h1>Important Concepts in HTML </h1>
  
  <b>The world wide web</b>
  <p>The web consists of a huge number of interconnected
  computers that communicate with each other in order to
    deliver content from a source to a user who seeks it.
    When a user navigates to a given site - say Alta Vista - 
    their web browser sends a <em>HTTP Request</em> to a 
    <b>server</b>, which then returns the appropiate HTML
    document back to the user. The user's web browser interprets
    the HTML and displays the page on screen as it is meant 
    to be seen by the user!
  </p>
  
  <b>HTML - <em>Hypertext Markup Languange</em></b>
  <p>HTML documents for the majority of the content found on
    the web. HTML is made up of text content, markup, references
    to other documents, and links. The text content 
    describes "what you see" and the markup describes "how 
    it looks."
  </p>
  
  <b>HTML Markup</b>
  <p>In HTML, we use <strong>tags</strong> to <em>markup</em>,
    or style, the content. For example, we can <b>bold our text,</b>
     or <em>use italics to place an emphasis on something 
     important</em> just by using tags to alert the web browser
     how to display the text content.<br>
     <br>
     Computers don't use any judgement when displaying HTML
     for the user. Any programming mistakes will result in the
     display of an
     end product that does not reflecting what was meant by the 
     programmer! 
     </p>
  
  <b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
  
  <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>.
    Block elements, which include paragraph, form, and div, possess
    an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Inline
    elements do not possess this invisible box. Some examples of
    inline elements are: span, break, image, bold, and anchor.
    <br><br>
    Characteristics of block elements will be important for properly
    styling the pages I want to create later.
  </p>
  
  <b>HTML Structure</b>
  
  <p> A typical HTML document follows this structure:<br><br>
  HTML doctype indicator<br>
  Opening HTML tag<br>
  Head section (contains meta-data, title, CSS, JS)<br>
  Body Section (contains content)<br>
  Closing of HTML tag
  </p>
